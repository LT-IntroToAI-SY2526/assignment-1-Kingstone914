# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used? Python was very confusing at first, but when I started learning it starts to clear up. It's very different compared to scratch but I can connect scratch and python like the if then statements.

2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.
I'm new to programming and Python. Introduce and guide me through on how to write an function to do simple division without giving me the answers. I learned how the code works together to carry out an output and what each line contributes to the output.
3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?
Writing an factorial was the most challenging because I didn't understand what each line of code does. I used AI to guide me on writing a function for factorial line by line without giving me the answers.
4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?
I learned the AI could actually be helpful and useful on learning material without giving you the answer. The best strategy for learning when using AI is to make the AI question what comes up next not just giving you the answer. The AI goes step by step making sure you understand hwat everything does, you should just have to use ai correctly.
